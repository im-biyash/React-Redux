# React + Vite
# Redux State Management Example

This repository contains a simple React application that demonstrates the usage of Redux for state management. In this application, Redux is utilized to manage a counter state.

## Overview

In this application, we have a basic React setup with Redux integrated to manage the state of a counter. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, which helps in managing application state in a more organized and scalable way.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

4. Start the development server:

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you'll see a simple interface with a counter displayed. You can increment or decrement the counter using the provided buttons. The counter state is managed using Redux.

## Folder Structure

- `src/actions`: Contains Redux action creators.
- `src/components`: Contains React components.
- `src/reducers`: Contains Redux reducers.
- `src/store`: Configures the Redux store.

## How Redux is Used

Redux is used in this application to manage the state of the counter. Here's a brief overview of how Redux is implemented:

- **Actions**: Define action types and action creators to update the state.
- **Reducers**: Define how the state should change in response to actions.
- **Store**: Configures the Redux store, which holds the application's state.
